Enclosed is a copy of the FOX v1.6 tests. They are almost unmodified except for the addition of a FXProcess instantiation at the start of main.

Note that some of these WILL NOT COMPILE PROPERLY unless FOXCompatLayer=True
 in config.py. Pass -k to scons if you want it to ignore failures to compile.
