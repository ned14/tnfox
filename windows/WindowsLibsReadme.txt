WindowsLibs.rar contains **MSVC9** release builds for the third
party libraries used by TnFOX. Both x86 and x64 versions are
present and these save you having to build your own (though you
will still need the sources for their headers).

Here are the versions:

libbzip2 v1.0.5

libjpeg v6b

libpng v1.2.29
libtiff v3.8.2
zlib v1.2.3
openssl v0.9.8g
